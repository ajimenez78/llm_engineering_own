# Un ejemplo de proceso de pensamiento

Here is my chess thought process:

1. WHY? What are **all** the things my opponent's move does? What are all the checks, captures and threats for both sides? Is his move safe?
2. PLAN? What are all the positive things I want to do? Create or update my TO DO list. This is the planning step and importantly includes executing or stopping tactics.
3. HOW? What are all the moves that might accomplish one or more of my goals? Create a list of those moves.
4. SAFE? Of those initial moves in my list, which ones are not safe? Discard those from the list.
5. BEST? Of the final candidate moves in my list, which one is the best?
6. SANE? Write down my move and then do a double check to make sure there are no hanging pieces, mates in one, etc. that could immediately hurt me. If everything is safe, make my move and punch the clock.
