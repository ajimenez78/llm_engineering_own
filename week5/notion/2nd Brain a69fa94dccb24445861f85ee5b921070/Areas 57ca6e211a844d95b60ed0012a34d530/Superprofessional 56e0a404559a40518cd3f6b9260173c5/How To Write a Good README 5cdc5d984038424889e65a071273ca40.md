# How To Write a Good README

README’S should tell the viewer how to install and use the project

there is only one bad way: not to include a README at all.

- **Project Title**: the name of your project
- **Description**:
You should describe the main purpose of your project. Answer questions like “why
did you build this project?” and “what problem(s) does it solve?”. It
also helps to include your motivations for the project and what you
learned from it.
- **Features**:
    
    If your project has multiple features, list them here. You can even add screenshots and gifs to show off the features.
    
- **How to use**:
step-by-step instructions on how to install and use your project. Any software or package requirements should also be listed here.
- **Technologies**:
    
    all the technologies and/or frameworks you used and what purpose they serve in your project.
    
- **Collaborators**:
If others have contributed to your project in any way, it is important
to give them credit for their work.
- **License**:
You can use [this guide](https://choosealicense.com/) to help you choose a license.

Keep README’s brief but detailed

up-to-date and self-explanatory.

Go for images or videos to make a project more understandable and appealing
