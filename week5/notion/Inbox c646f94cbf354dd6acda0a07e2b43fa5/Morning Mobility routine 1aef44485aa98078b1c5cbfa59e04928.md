[Pro Tip:](https://thereadystate.com/blogs/10-minute-morning-mobility-routine/#lightbox-html-video-be00abd6ee) Don’t forget to switch sides. It’s easy to focus on problem areas. But this mobility work behavior won’t do you good in the long run.

Do them both..Choose the one that is more difficult and makes you uncomfortable. Use these mobility workouts alongside the [Virtual Mobility Coach](https://thereadystate.com/) to open your day.

It won’t matter. Remember: The best morning mobility routine is one that lets you leave the house, [ready](https://thereadystate.com/).

### How do you structure a mobility stretch routine?

Following are some general guidelines for structuring a mobility session. Tweak them based on your needs:

- Warm up to increase blood flow to your muscles
- Perform joint rotation exercises involving each major joint
- Incorporate dynamic stretches to improve functional range of motion.
- Perform mobility drills or exercises that target your problem areas or areas you wish to improve. Common examples such as the hip flexors or the shoulder blades.
- Wrap up with a cool down exercises to relax your muscles

When building a full body morning mobility routine, ALWAYS listen to your body. Observe how your body responds to daily mobility routine.
